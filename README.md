# Goal: Develop a Malicious URL Detector

A crucial step in this project is to clearly define the objective: developing an ML-enhanced tool called the **Malicious URL Detector**.

### What are Malicious URLs?

Malicious URLs—also known as abnormal or suspicious URLs—are web addresses that exhibit patterns or behaviors indicative of cyber threats, such as phishing, malware distribution, or other deceptive practices. These URLs pose significant risks to both users and organizations.

### Key Characteristics of Malicious URLs

To understand what sets malicious URLs apart, here are some common traits:
1. **Misspelled Domain Names**: Attackers often register domains resembling legitimate websites but include subtle misspellings or variations (e.g., *goo-gle.com* instead of *google.com*).
2. **Use of IP Addresses Instead of Domains**: Some malicious URLs use raw IP addresses rather than domain names to bypass domain registration and complicate tracking.
3. **Long, Random Strings**: URLs containing long, random strings of characters often aim to obscure their true purpose.
4. **Unusual Characters or Symbols**: Excessive use of special characters, such as hyphens or underscores, can confuse users or evade detection systems.
5. **Lack of HTTPS**: Phishing sites often avoid using valid SSL certificates (HTTPS), making them less secure and more suspect.
6. **Excessive Subdirectories**: Malicious URLs might include numerous subdirectories to obfuscate the true destination.
7. **Suspicious or Uncommon TLDs**: Attackers may use less familiar or dubious top-level domains (TLDs) to make the URL appear misleading.

### The Importance of Malicious URL Detection

Detecting malicious URLs is critical in modern cybersecurity to combat phishing, malware, and other digital threats. Numerous methods and tools are employed for this purpose, including:
- **URL Scanners**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**
- **Heuristic Techniques**

These technologies are integral to the security and networking features of modern applications. By analyzing a wealth of existing approaches, I am committed to designing a robust solution—carefully justifying and documenting each step of the process—to deliver meaningful and impactful results.
